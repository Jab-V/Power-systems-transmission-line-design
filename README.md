# Power-systems-transmission-line-design
Climate change and air pollution have a direct impact on the performance
and lifetime of insulating materials. In recent years, Mazandaran and Golestan
provinces in Iran have witnessed a climate change and an increase in air pollu-
tion. This problem increases outages and losses in transmission and overhead
distribution network. Moreover, traditional and empirical methods have been
used for insulation coordination in past decades. As a result, research is needed
on the regional power line isolation, revision of insulated surface design, and
the number of insulators used. In this paper, a specialized software was used
for checking existing lines in Mazandaran and Golestan Regional Power. Insu-
lation computations and isolation studies using MATLAB software were used to
present solutions for transmission and overhead distribution networks. This spe-
cialized software has the ability to calculate the required minimum air gap and
the minimum creepage distance and the number of insulators with due atten-
tion to regional pollution, overvoltage due to switching and lightning, and power
frequency.
